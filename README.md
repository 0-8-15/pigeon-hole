# A mailbox constrained by capacity.

* API similar to mailbox.

* No timeouts we love our pigeons too much.

* Flow control.  `send/blocking!` blocks if capacity is exceeded.

# API

    (: isa? (* -> boolean : :dequeue:))

Test predicate for {{PIGEON-HOLE}}.

     (: make (&optional NAME #!key (capacity: 0) -> :dequeue:))

Return a {{PIGEON-HOLE}} contrained by capacity.

    (: size (:dequeue: -> fixnum))

Return number of pigeons in {{PIGEON-HOLE}}.

    (: empty? (:dequeue: -> boolean))

Test {{PIGEON-HOLE}} to be empty.

    (: count (:dequeue: -> fixnum))

Return number of waiters on {{PIGEON-HOLE}}.

    (: send! (:dequeue: VALUE -> boolean))

Immediately send {{VALUE}} to {{PIGEON-HOLE}}.  Does *not* respect
capacity limits!

    (: send/blocking! (:dequeue: * -> boolean))

Send {{VALUE}} to {{PIGEON-HOLE}}, blocks if capacity is reached.

    (: receive! (:dequeue: -> *))

Receive value from {{PIGEON-HOLE}}, current thread may block if
capacity is exeeded.
